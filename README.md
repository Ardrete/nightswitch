# NightSwitch

Automatically switches your VS Code theme between specified day and night themes.

## Features

Allows for automatic geolocation based on IP and manual GPS coordinate location.

Geolocation is not turn on out of the box to protect privacy, however if you want to turn it on just invoke the setting `"nightswitch.geolocation": true`.

## Requirements

None. Probably safer to set your main theme to either the day or night theme from the outset though.

## Extension Settings

I'll do this in a bit... just look at package.json or your settings file for docs:

## Known Issues

May have some synchronization issues. Haven't removed console logs yet.

## Release Notes

Allows for GPS coordinate location, geolocation, manual input.

### 0.0.1

Initial release. Still probably pretty buggy (I wrote this pretty hastily).
